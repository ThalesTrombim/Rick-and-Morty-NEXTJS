#  Rick and Morty | NextJS 


## About Project

This project was made for study more about NextJs.

The gereneral ideia is list and find series characters, and also read a little about them.


### ðŸ”Ž Overview

In this project I used Next Js and TailwindCss for styles. On the technical side, the home page used getStaticProps from nexts and the character page used getServerSideProps from NextJs as well. The characters list is come from [Rick and morty api](https://rickandmortyapi.com/). And has its own backend api for registering character descriptions.
